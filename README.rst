What is ``iot-automator``?
-----------------------------

``iot-automator`` is a library for building complex IoT device automations using Python
with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness and scalability.

``iot-automator`` works with many common, off the shelf hubs and devices, but introduces infinite freedom to automate any device or environment.
The library abstracts a number of popular IoT automation solutions, like WebThings Gateway, Samsung Smart Things,
Home Assistant, Amazon Alexa, OpenHAB, and more in the future.
The library provides a simple, object-oriented interface for building automation solutions that spans across these hubs and devices,
introducing a new level of flexibility and scalability to IoT automation.
