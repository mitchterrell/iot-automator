Tools
=========================

All developers are welcome to use whatever tools that they would like, but they are encouraged 
to use some of the tools below. 

------------------

Python
--------

We are currently working off of Python **3.7.6**, but plan to support more versions in the future. We likely will 
not be supporting any Python 2 versions.

    **TODO -- I need a better list**

    **TODO -- There are better ways to track package requirments for PyPip**



    - ``pip install -U sphinx``
        - Sphinx is the doucumentation tool
    - ``pip install furo``
        - Sphinx theme
    - ``pip install sphinx_design``
        - Sphinx add on that has some nice additions
    - ``pip install sphinx-copybutton``
        - Sphinx add on that gives a copy button next to admontions


------------------


IDE
----

.. note::
	We understand that IDE's are very near and dear to developers hearts, this is just a suggestion and what we are using.


We are using **Visual Studio 2022 - Community** for development. Below are some add-ons and configuration details that make 
development easier.

.. dropdown:: Installing & Configuring VS 2022
    :animate: fade-in-slide-down

    By following the above link you can download Visual Studio 2022. We use community edition such that we do not have 
    to pay extra, but professional and enterprise will work as well.

    When choosing a configuration, we suggest using the attached configuration file for importing settings.

Version Control
-----------------

Git
****

Git is only source control that we will be using for this project. I am using **v2.36**

    Git 2.36.1 Download :octicon:`link-external;1em;sd-text-warning`



SourceTree
***********

SourceTree is a free tool that I use for a lot of Git stuff. It has a super clean UI and works better than some of the IDE 
embedded version control systems (IMO).

Documentation:
---------------

Figma
******

For diagram generation and process flow mapping, I have recently been using Figma. It is an awesome tool and does not have a crazy 
pay wall limiting you from features.

.. note::
    I recommend downloading the Desktop client, although the browswer version contains all the same features.

Sphinx + ReadTheDocs
************************

Sphinx and ReadTheDocs are two tools that we will use a lot for strong documentation for this project. 

**TODO: Some more notes here would be nice**

You can learn more about both below:
